Quick Guide To Exporting a Site From BLOX
#########################################

Open site in Townnews, then select Design/Templates.

Global Skins
============

Click on Site Templates in the tree, then Global Skins. You'll see one
or more skins with the default (in-use) skin highlighted. Unless
you're developing with a different skin, that's the one you
want. Right-click on the skin and choose export. The filename of the
downloaded ZIP file doesn't matter; just accept the default.

Application Skins
=================

Click on the tree branch labelled "Skins". You'll get a drop down of
applications like "Ad-Owl", "Business", "Editorial", etc.

For each application of interest, click on the application to see a
list of the modules that make up that application. For each module,
right-click and choose "Export..."

Blocks
======

Click on the tree branch labelled "Blocks". You'll get a **lot** of
them and may have to wait a while. For every block you want to
cross-reference, right-click and choose "Export".

Components
==========

By now you've got the picture. Clicking on the "Components" branch
gives a long list of packages, each of which must be right-clicked and
"Export"ed.

Certified Packages
==================

Important note: packages which are "certified" by Townnews are the
same for different sites if they have the same name **and
version**. So it may be worthwhile checking against a list of
certified packages already in the system; there's no need to export
any already present. Customized packages unfortunately may be
different even if they have the same name and version, so you'll
always want to get those.
